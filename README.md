This web app was developed as part of Project 3 of the Code Academy Berlin program. The app works with two different API’s, one of them the PONS’ online Dictionary API and its purpose is to help me increase my German vocabulary.  The project consisted in building a free-of-choice Web Progressive App using Firebase as back-end. In the Words tab, any word can be searched or you can get a random one. Then, the primary data is displayed along with its main definitions. The info button shows more information about the word such as phonetics, gender, part of speech, among others. The word can be saved in a unique Vocabulary by clicking the add button. Once the definition is saved, personalized notes can be added.
